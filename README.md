🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis using SQL

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to answer real-world business questions related to revenue, customer demand, and product performance. The analysis demonstrates the use of joins, aggregations, grouping, subqueries, and window functions to extract meaningful insights from relational data.

🎯 Objective
1. Analyze sales performance and revenue trends
2. Identify popular pizza types, sizes, and categories
3. Demonstrate strong SQL querying and analytical skills

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of four relational tables:
1. orders – order date and time
2. order_details – quantity of pizzas ordered
3. pizzas – pizza size and price
4. pizza_types – pizza name and category
These tables are joined to perform end-to-end sales analysis.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
1. SQL (MySQL compatible)
2. GitHub
Dataset: Pizza Sales Dataset

📊 Business Questions Solved
